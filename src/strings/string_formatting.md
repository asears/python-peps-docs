## t-strings
- **Definition**: t-strings are a type of string formatting that allows for the inclusion of variables and expressions within a string.
- **Syntax**: They are typically defined using the `t` prefix, but this is not a standard feature in Python. Instead, the term is often used informally to refer to template strings or similar constructs.
- **Use Case**: t-strings are useful when you want to create a string that includes dynamic content, but they may require additional libraries or methods to implement effectively.

## f-strings
- **Definition**: f-strings, or formatted string literals, were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`.
- **Syntax**: An f-string is defined by prefixing the string with the letter `f` or `F`. For example: `name = "World"; greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"`.
- **Use Case**: f-strings are preferred for their simplicity and readability. They allow for inline expressions and can include any valid Python expression, making them very versatile.

## When to Use Each
- **t-strings**: Use t-strings when you need a more complex string formatting that may involve external libraries or specific formatting rules not covered by standard Python string methods.
- **f-strings**: Use f-strings for most string formatting needs in Python 3.6 and later, as they are more concise, easier to read, and generally more efficient than other formatting methods.
