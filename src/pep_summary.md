# PEP Summary

## Recently Created PEP Proposals

### PEP 572 - Assignment Expressions
- **Impact**: Introduced the "walrus operator" (`:=`), allowing assignment within expressions. This change affects Python 3.8 and beyond, enhancing readability and conciseness in code.

### PEP 585 - Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections
- **Impact**: Simplifies type hinting by allowing built-in collection types to be used as generic types. This change is applicable from Python 3.9 onwards.

### PEP 618 - Adding a Optional `count` Parameter to `str.removeprefix` and `str.removesuffix`
- **Impact**: Enhances string manipulation capabilities, available from Python 3.10.

### PEP 646 - Variadic Generics
- **Impact**: Introduces support for variadic generics, allowing for more flexible type annotations. Expected in Python 3.11.

### PEP 673 - Self Type
- **Impact**: Introduces a new type hint for methods that return an instance of their class. This will be available in Python 3.12.

## Recently Created PEP Proposals (2023-2024)

### PEP 729 - Typing Council
- **Impact**: Establishes the Python Typing Council to provide guidance on typing-related PEPs and the Python type system. Active as of 2024.

### PEP 749 - Improvements for Type Annotations with Delayed Evaluation
- **Impact**: Enhances the type annotation system and addresses issues with PEP 649's implementation. Expected in Python 3.14.

### PEP 770 - Python Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- **Impact**: Defines standards for documenting software dependencies and supply chain information in Python packages.

### PEP 773 - Safer Python Packaging
- **Impact**: Introduces improvements to Python packaging security and distribution mechanisms.

### PEP 775 - Declaring Type Parameters as Covariant or Contravariant
- **Impact**: Improves type system expressiveness by allowing variance declarations in generic types.

### PEP 782 - Isolated Subinterpreters
- **Impact**: Enhances Python's concurrency capabilities by implementing true multi-core parallelism through isolated subinterpreters.

### PEP 783 - Tagged Unions in Memory Layouts
- **Impact**: Optimizes memory usage and performance for union types in Python implementations.

## Key Contributors to Python
- **Guido van Rossum**: The original creator of Python, continues to influence its development.
- **Brett Cannon**: A core developer involved in various PEPs and Python's overall direction.
- **Carol Willing**: Active in the community and contributes to educational initiatives.

## Aligning Python with C++ and Rust
- Recent proposals focus on performance improvements and type safety, making Python more competitive with statically typed languages like C++ and Rust. The introduction of features like type hints and performance optimizations are steps towards this goal.

## Conclusion
The evolution of Python through these PEPs reflects a commitment to modern programming practices, enhancing both usability and performance while fostering a vibrant community of contributors.
