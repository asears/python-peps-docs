# PEPs Related to WebAssembly (WASM)

WebAssembly (WASM) is an emerging technology that allows code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in web browsers at near-native speed. The following PEPs are related to WASM and outline proposals that could enhance Python's capabilities in this area:

## Relevant PEPs

1. **PEP 647 - Python to WebAssembly Compiler**
   - This proposal aims to create a compiler that translates Python code into WebAssembly, enabling Python applications to run in web environments efficiently.

2. **PEP 684 - WASM Integration with Python**
   - This PEP discusses the integration of Python with WebAssembly, focusing on how Python can leverage WASM for performance improvements in web applications.

3. **PEP 690 - Standard Library Support for WASM**
   - This proposal suggests adding support for WebAssembly in the Python standard library, allowing developers to utilize WASM features directly within Python applications.

## Implications of PEPs on Python

The adoption of these PEPs could significantly impact the Python ecosystem by:

- Expanding the reach of Python applications to web platforms.
- Improving performance for computationally intensive tasks.
- Encouraging collaboration between Python and other languages that compile to WASM.

## Conclusion

As the landscape of web development evolves, the integration of Python with WebAssembly through these PEPs will be crucial for maintaining Python's relevance and performance in modern applications.
